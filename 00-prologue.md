# Prologue

For Amy, Daniel, and many others to come.

It is my greatest hope that you don't need the advice in this book. 

In case I fall short in my duties to you, I write everything I understand here. At 28 I have found _conventional wisdom_ to be expired and the leaders of my time to be transient and not worth following.

More to follow.
