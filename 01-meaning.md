# Meaning

Meaning is the foundation of life. Every person, either by intent or accident, has some meaning to their life. 

Chose yours to be by intent. By design. Start simple, refine constantly, and remember that meaning is not a by-product of who you are, rather, what you are called to do.


## In 500 Words

Meaning is the foundation of your life.

Everything in your life wants to be "the meaning.".

Start simple. Re-evaluate constantly. Your true meaning will always allude you, but someone you'll always know.

Use your meaning to frame your life.

Every morning remind yourself why you are here. Every night reflect on the day.

"Be like a wise man who built his house on the rock," build your life on something deep, meaningful, and eternal. Not feeling good. Not doing what's popular. It has to be more than yourself. It has to be something worth living for. Something worth dying for. Life will come. There will be days of joy and days of suffering. 

"And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock".
