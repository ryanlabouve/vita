# Meaning

Meaning is the foundation of life. This is true for Every person, either by intent or accident.

Be intentional about the meaning of your life. Start simple. Refine constantly. Remember that meaning is not a by-product of who you are. Rather meaning is the manifestation of who you chose to be.

## In 500 Words

Meaning is the foundation of your life.

Everything in your life wants to be "the meaning.""

Start simple. Re-evaluate constantly. Your true meaning is like a song that you have stuck in your head but can't quite remember. You'll know it when you hear it, but it's quite illusive to search for directly.

Use meaning to frame your life. Question everything you do regularly as your meaning continues to unfold.

Every morning remind yourself why you are here. Every night reflect on the day.

"Be like a wise man who built his house on the rock," build your life on something deep, meaningful, and eternal. Not feeling good. Not doing what's popular. It has to be more than yourself. It has to be something worth living for. Something worth dying for. Life will come. There will be days of joy and days of suffering.

"And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock".

## Troubleshooting

### Am I in trouble?

* [ ] Do you feel like one of the hosts in the opening sequence of Westworld season one? — each day is the same and you never really "move the plot forward"

* [ ] Do you feel overwhelming dread or anxiety about your life?

* [ ] If your life was a movie, would you watch it?

### How to correct?

* 1. Find God by looking daily.

* 2. Take 48 hours away from everything to seek meaning.

* 3. Simplify. Throw everything away you don't absolutely need. Stop doing everything you don't absolutely have to do.

* 4. Practice habits & routines that maintain you on the right course.

## Other thoughts

### Personal Mantra

Here's what I started with:

> Love & Conquer

### Journalling

It's hard to remember things. Write them down. I suggest making this part of your daily routine. Just 5 minutes.

### Faith

In the prologue of my book I make it clear that this is a book to my kids. So I am including personal things about my faith.

#### Why am I a Cristian?

Let's not beat around the bush— I believe in Jesus. I believe in what he said, the works he did while he was here, that he died for my sins, and the future he calls us to. Much of this section on "meaning" relates directly to "bear your own cross."

To boil it down into two items:

* Love your neighbor as yourself— Jesus made it clear that we are all to live self-sacrificially to help the people around us. Not just our friends, but everyone around is.

* Love God above everything else— Yes, I believe in God. The capital `G` deity. Bearer of the tetragrammaton. Creator of man. God is the root of my being.

#### How can I be a Christian?

You can't be Christian without being like Christ.

Seek Christ by reading the bible every day. Make a commitment to read at least 2 chapters a day. Don't bother with the old testament until you've read the new testament at least 10 time.

Pray every day. Talk to Jesus. He listens. He responds.

Worship him constantly, thru service and song.

Memorize the scripture. Make his words your words. Write them on the walls of your heart.

Actively practice being like Christ.

Even when it's scary, even when it's strange, center your life around the truth of God.

Be a witness to what he's done, especially in your life.

Love is everything. Love God. Love your neighbors. Love recklesly.  

My Recommendations:
* [ ] Read / listen to 4 chapters a day as part of your daily routine(10-15 minutes)
* [ ] Pray 2 times a day (10 minutes)
* [ ] Meditate for 10 minutes or worship though 2 songs
