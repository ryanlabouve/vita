"Money makes a great servant, but a terrible master."

## In 500 Words

Money is either your servant or your master. It will never be your friend. And remember, you can only have one master.

My 2 centsâ€”

* You will spend a lot of our life "working,"... You will have two basic options: make work and meaning as aligned as possible. Or, work as little as possible so you can focus on other things. Pick one of those options and stick to it hard. Never get caught between.

* Debt is always bad. Don't buy what you can't afford

* For finances simple if more effective than clever

* Boundaries and trends are significant. Don't fret over the details, obsess over the trends.

* A number watched tends to improve.

* Your power to accumulate wealth depends heavily on `total needed / total earned`. Aim for > 30%. This means make more or spend less. With 30% extra you have the power to change the course of your finances.

## Troubleshooting

### Am I in trouble?

* [ ] Have you calculated a monthly total for your budget that you stick to where `total needed / total earned` > 30%

* [ ] Have you met the _first steps in financial security_?

If you have not answered yes to both of those questions, you are in trouble.

### How to correct?

First step: Immediately secure `total needed / total earned` > 30%. Spend less. Make more. You have 2 weeks to make this happen. Sell everything. Cancel anything that costs money every month

Second step: Save a nest egg of 1K. You have another 2 weeks. Get a second job. This is your priority.

Third step: Use your 30% extra cash to: save 3 months of survival cash and pay off high interest debts.

This can be a very difficult rut to get out of if you are in it. But this must be your priority.

Money stress has been the root of most bad decisions I've made in my life. Achieving a basic financial security is a fundamental building block in your life.
