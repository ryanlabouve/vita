"Money makes a great servant, but a terrible master."

## In 500 Words

Money is either your first servant or your first master. It will never be your friend and should never your god.

Here's my 2 cents...

* You will spend a lot of our life "working."... You will have two basic options: make work and meaning as aligned as possible. Or, work as little as possible so you can focus on other things.

* Debt is always bad. Don't buy what you can't afford

* Simple > Clever

* Boundaries and trends are signifigant. Don't fret over the details, obsess over the trends.

* Your power to accumulate wealth depends heavily on `total needed / total earned`. Aim for > 30%. This means make more or spend less. With 30% extra you have the power to change the course of your finances.
