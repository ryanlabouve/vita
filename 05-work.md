### Troubleshooting

#### Am I in trouble?

#### How to correct?

Start by being good at your work:

Work to 2 or 3 big goals a day.

Plan 2-3 "deep work" times, 90-120 minutes. During these time, turn off notifications. Drag the times out on your calendar the day before and treat them like meetings.

Plan your lunch time. This is an important boundary. 

Executing work is all about timers. 
5 minutes to plan. Take your "goal" and break it down into logical categories. And then break down the first logical category a little further.

Next, pomodoro.

20 minute times. Ignore everything for 20 minutes at a time. Have a small goal. Nail it. rest for 2 minutes. Repeat. 

After work is over, stop working. If you must, try to only have one "late night" a week, and make it consistent.

Next, spend 2 hours a day trying to puruse another job.

This will look very different for each person.

I think one common this is: "Death by 1000 cuts"

Have one planning day for every 7-10 working days. Each day try to get 1-2 hours in of straight work.

0 planning. Just execute. Timebox it. It won't happen if you don't. It will run other things if you don't.
